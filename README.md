# Data mining methods in signatures automatic discovery

This is a project to implement a method based on frequent sequential patterns mining.
The method can automatically identify signatures of new network applications. These extracted signatures will be further used in network traffic classification systems. Different from traditional methods, where signatures are manually extracted by specialists with domain knowledge. New network applications are increasing by days. The artificial method is inefficient to the proprietary applications with private protocols. That causes it cannot satisfy a classifier to recognize up-to-day new applications. The new method is developed to solve the above problem by generating signatures from an application traffic automatically. The analyzed signatures are presented as regular expressions, that can be easily integrated into many well established classification systems.
